It uses a dataset of emails, processes the text, and trains a model to classify whether an email is spam or not.  

## Features  
- Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal)  
- Model training using Naive Bayes  
- Accuracy evaluation  

## How to Run  
1. Clone this repository  
2. Open `spam_mail_2.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook  
3. Run all cells to train and test the model  

## Requirements  
- Python 3.x  
- scikit-learn
